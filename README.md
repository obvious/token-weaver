Weaver is a [GitHub Action] to transform the [Figma Token Studio] tokens to platform specific theme files
using [Amazon Style Dictionary]

## Usage

```yaml
uses: obvious/weaver@v0.0.1
with:
  tokens_path: 'tokens/tokens.json'
  output_path: 'output'

# Raise PRs adding the generated files
```

### Inputs

- `tokens_path` (**Required**): Path to the Figma Token Studio `tokens.json` file
- `output_path` (**Required**): Path to write the generated files to

### Output

Generates foundation(colors, typography, theme token files) in `output` folder. Which can
then be used to upload to the workflow or open PRs directly.

For example, the [`test_build_tokens`] workflow generates these outputs that are uploaded as an workflow artifact.

```
android
✔︎ ../output/android/res/colors.xml
✔︎ ../output/android/res/base_theme.xml
✔︎ ../output/android/res/theme_attrs.xml

ios
✔︎ ../output/iOS/BaseColor.swift
✔︎ ../output/iOS/ThemeColors.swift
✔︎ ../output/iOS/Theme.swift
```
